{"name":"Spoc","tagline":"Stream Processing with OCaml","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbourgoin/SPOC.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbourgoin/SPOC)\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOC is a set of tools for GPGPU programming with OCaml.\r\n\r\nThe SPOC library enables the detection and use of GPGPU devices with OCaml using Cuda and OpenCL. \r\nThere is also a camlp4 syntax extension to handle external Cuda or OpenCL kernels, as well as a DSL to express GPGPU kernels from the OCaml code.\r\n\r\nThis work was part of my PhD thesis and was partially funded by the opengpu project. \r\nI'm currently in the UPMC-LIP6 laboratory.\r\n\r\nIt has currently been tested on multiple architectures and systems, mostly 64-bit Linux and 64-bit OSX systems. It should work with Windows too.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use SPOC, you'll need a computer capable of running OCaml (obviously) but also compatible with either OpenCL or Cuda. \r\nFor Cuda you only need a current proprietary NVidia driver while for OpenCL you need to install the correct OpenCL implementation for your system. \r\nSPOC should compile anyway as everything is dynamically linked, but you'll need Cuda/OpenCL eventually to run your programs.\r\n\r\nSPOC currently lacks a real tutorial, it comes with some examples and I strongly advise anyone interested to look into the slides and papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n#I - How to Build SPOC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 1 - Dependencies \r\n\r\nRequires :\r\n    \r\n    * ocaml >= 4.01.0\r\n    * camlp4\r\n    * ocamlfind \r\n    * ocp-build\r\n    \r\nFor cuda compilation :\r\n\r\n    * nvcc    \r\n\r\n## 2 - Compilation & Installation\r\n\r\n\r\nTo compile SPOC:\r\ncd Spoc\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3 - Build Documentation\r\n\r\n\r\nmake htdoc\r\nWill build the ocamldoc html pages in the Spoc/docs directory\r\n\r\n\r\n# II - Testing SPOC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Samples\" directory contains few programs using SPOC.\r\n\r\nTo compile those programs:\r\ncd Samples\r\nmake\r\n\r\nBinaries will be located in the Samples/build folder\r\n\r\n\r\n# III - SPOCLIBS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"SpocLibs\" directory contains few libraries based on Spoc.\r\n - Compose allows basic composition over GPGPU kernels\r\n - Cublas allows to use some functions of the Cublas library \r\n   (Cublas needs Cuda SDK to compile)\r\n - Sarek is a embedded DSL for OCaml to express kernels from the OCaml program\r\n\r\nThe Sample directory contains few samples using those libraries\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
